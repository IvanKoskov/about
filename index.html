    <h1>Welcome to My Skills Page!</h1>
    <p>Here is a list of my technical skills and areas of expertise:</p>

    <div class="skills">
        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <div class="skill">
            <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
            <p>I know C++ the best of all now, understanding of OOP and software design with it is very familiar and clear to me. This is also supported by good knowledge in the Qt C++ library, which is a powerful set of tools for native, fast software development. C is well understood as my first language that I learned, but I prefer C++ over it. I also know Objective-C and its OOP foundation for app development. Dart is another language I am familiar with, as I have learned how to use Flutter and created some simple apps with it. I have also studied SQL, specifically PostgreSQL for databases. Additionally, I am familiar with shell scripting (bash).</p>
            <p>Aside from that, I am comfortable with Unix-like systems and understand their fundamentals, working in them and more. These include Linux and macOS.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p>I'm not into web development. It's just important to note that I'm familiar with basic frontend development, Figma, and the overall principles. I know HTML and CSS for styling, and I won't include Flutter here as it is primarily for app development and not web development.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <h3>Tools and Platforms</h3>
            <p>I use GitHub (Git), CMake, Makefile, Xcode (as an IDE), VS Code, terminal skills, and have a strong familiarity with working in the terminal. I understand piping, flows, and more. I've used Vim for a while and DBeaver for databases.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <h3>Other Skills</h3>
            <p>I have soft skills like critical thinking and an understanding of various applications.</p>
